                        <p>Our three styles of travel – Basix, Original and Comfort – cover a whole gamut of travel experiences. To find out which one has ‘You’ written all over it, visit our destination page.</p>

                        <p>Want to lie in a hammock and not move until cocktail hour? We’ve got a trip for that. Want to power up the side of mountain at high altitude? We’ve also got a trip for that. To determine what type of trip suits you best, each of our trips comes with a Physical Rating to let you know how physically demanding it is… or isn’t. </p>

                        <p>As a solo traveller, you will be paired up with another passenger of the same gender as per your passport information. If you’re not comfortable sharing a room with someone of the same gender, you also have the choice to pay for a single supplement (available on the majority of our trips).If you don’t identify with the gender assigned on your passport, please let us know at time of booking and we’ll arrange the rooming configuration accordingly. </p>

                        <p>The vast majority of our small group adventures are guaranteed to depart. That means that once you book your trip it’s confirmed to run, regardless of how many other travellers have booked. You can easily tell which departures are guaranteed by looking for 'guaranteed departure' next to your chosen travel date.</p>
